# Forge: teaching a 1.5B model to reason with RL on one 8GB GPU

[![CI](https://github.com/pratyushpad/Forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pratyushpad/Forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Forge trains Qwen2.5-1.5B to solve math by reasoning, using GRPO (reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards, the technique behind DeepSeek-R1) instead of
supervised fine-tuning, on a single RTX 5060.** It lifts GSM8K pass@1 from **58.8%
to 70.0%** with no measured loss of general ability, then quantizes and serves the
result behind one interface with a hosted fallback.

## ▶ Live demo: [forge-grpo.vercel.app](https://forge-grpo.vercel.app)

The [**playground**](https://forge-grpo.vercel.app/playground) runs **real inference on a
live GPU**: type any grade-school math problem and watch the stock base model and the GRPO-tuned
adapter answer it side by side, streaming. Both are served from a single vLLM process via
multi-LoRA, using the same 73MB adapter the training run produced rather than a merged copy.
It scales to zero between visits, so the first request spends about 60-90s waking the
container before tokens start.

## 10-second results (all measured, seed 3407)

| | base | Forge (GRPO) |
|---|---|---|
| **GSM8K pass@1** (1,319 held-out) | 58.8% | **70.0%** |
| ARC-Challenge (forgetting check) | 69.5% | 68.5% |

Trained in **86 min**, **3.64 GiB peak VRAM**. Reward went from **1.23 to 2.80** out of 3.25.

## Baseline notes: what 58.8% actually is

The 58.8% vs 70.0% comparison is deliberately apples-to-apples at the training
configuration, not a leaderboard reproduction:

- **Both columns ran the same 4-bit weights.** The base and tuned evals load the
  identical NF4-quantized checkpoint (`unsloth/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-unsloth-bnb-4bit`)
  via vLLM (the same weights training used), with the same one-shot prompt, greedy
  decoding, and seed 3407, over all 1,319 held-out test problems
  ([`eval/eval_gsm8k.py`](eval/eval_gsm8k.py), results in
  [`eval/results/gsm8k.json`](eval/results/gsm8k.json)). The only difference between
  the columns is the LoRA adapter, so the delta measures GRPO, not a precision,
  prompt, or harness change.
- **58.8% is the lenient base score** (any final number in the output counts).
  Scored strictly, where the answer must sit inside the trained `<answer>` tags, the base
  model gets 54.4%, because it doesn't reliably follow the format. The tuned model
  scores 70.0% under both rules; identical strict/lenient means 100% format
  compliance, nothing lost to parsing.
- **Don't compare 58.8% to Qwen's published GSM8K figure.** Published numbers for
  Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct come from a different protocol (full-precision weights and
  few-shot CoT eval harnesses) and land higher than this quantized, fixed-format,
  exact-match baseline. That's expected: the baseline here exists to isolate the
  training effect under the training configuration, not to reproduce the
  tech-report number.
- **The gain survives leaving 4-bit.** The adapter merged to fp16 scores **0.76**
  pass@1 on the first 100 held-out problems (vLLM/GPU), and the f16 GGUF agrees
  exactly at 0.76
  ([`eval/results/served_fp16_merged.json`](eval/results/served_fp16_merged.json),
  [`export/QUANT_DELTA.md`](export/QUANT_DELTA.md)). That is consistent with the 70.0%
  full-set figure (n=100 means roughly ±9 pts at 95% CI), so the improvement is not an
  artifact of the 4-bit eval path.

## Why GRPO

Supervised fine-tuning teaches a model to *imitate* answers. **GRPO teaches it to
*search***: it samples 8 completions per problem, scores each with a verifiable
reward (is the final number correct? is it formatted?), and pushes probability
toward the better-than-average ones. No human labels, no reward model, no LLM judge.
Just a math checker. That's what makes it a genuine reasoning-RL result rather
than a commodity fine-tune.

## Reward design

The reward functions *are* the training signal (`train/rewards.py`, max 3.25):
`correctness` +2.0, `format` +0.5, `numeric` +0.25, `tag_presence` +0.5 (graded).

**The bug worth reading about:** the first smoke run trained cleanly but every reward
was **0.0**. Qwen-1.5B ignored the format instruction, so no completion earned the
correctness or format reward, and with identical rewards in every group, GRPO's
advantage is zero and nothing learns. The model was getting the *math* right; it just
wouldn't use the tags. Two fixes: a **one-shot example** in the prompt, and a
**graded `tag_presence` reward** (+0.125 per tag) so partial compliance still creates
gradient. Rewards fired immediately after. This is the kind of failure GRPO is prone
to, and catching it is the point.

## Architecture

```
data/     GSM8K pipeline, dataset-agnostic {prompt, answer} schema
train/    reward functions + GRPO trainer (Unsloth + TRL, vLLM rollouts)
eval/     pass@1, forgetting check, reward-curve plot (committed, seeded)
export/   merge LoRA -> fp16 -> GGUF f16/Q4_K_M  (quality-vs-latency table)
serve/    vLLM (fp16/GPU) + Ollama (Q4/GPU), provider-agnostic client w/ fallback
          modal_app.py: the scale-to-zero GPU endpoint behind the live playground
demo/     Next.js site (5 routes); gen_examples.py / gen_traces.py build its data
```

Stack: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct · Unsloth 2026.7.3 · TRL 0.24 · vLLM 0.19.1 ·
torch 2.10+cu128 (Blackwell sm_120) · Python 3.11.

## Quickstart

```bash
# env: conda create -n forge python=3.11; pip install torch --index-url .../cu128
#      pip install unsloth vllm trl datasets transformers accelerate bitsandbytes
make test            # reward-function unit tests
make full-train      # GRPO, 750 steps x 8 gens  (~86 min, 3.64 GiB)
make eval            # base vs tuned pass@1 + ARC forgetting check
make export          # merge -> GGUF f16 + Q4_K_M
make serve-vllm      # OpenAI endpoint on :8000   (or serve-ollama for Q4)
```

Then stream from whichever backend is up (falls back to a hosted endpoint if the
box is off; see `serve/README.md`):

```python
from serve.client import ForgeClient
for tok in ForgeClient().stream("What is 7 * 8?"):
    print(tok, end="", flush=True)
```

## Serving performance (RTX 5060, single stream)

| backend | TTFT | tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| vLLM fp16 (GPU) | 19 ms | 105 (674 batched) |
| Ollama Q4_K_M (GPU) | 139 ms | 228 |

## Hardware constraints
8GB of VRAM is the binding constraint and it's documented, not hidden: peak VRAM is
reported for every phase, AWQ was deferred rather than risk the Blackwell stack, and
Q4's roughly 7-point quality cost is measured and stated. Numbers reproduce from
committed scripts.
