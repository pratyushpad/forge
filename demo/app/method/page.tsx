          <div className="prose">
            <p>
              For each problem the model samples a <b>group of 8 completions</b>. Every completion
              is scored by a reward function, and each one&apos;s <i>advantage</i> is simply how far
              its reward sits from the group&apos;s mean. Completions above the mean get pushed up,
              completions below it get pushed down, and a KL penalty keeps the whole thing tethered
              to the base model so it can&apos;t drift into nonsense that happens to score well.
            </p>
            <p>
              The interesting part is what&apos;s <em>missing</em>. Classic PPO needs a second
              network (a learned critic) to estimate how good a state is, and that critic costs as
              much memory as the policy. GRPO throws it away: <b>the group average is the
              baseline</b>. That single substitution is what lets this run on one consumer card
              instead of a cluster, and it&apos;s the technique behind DeepSeek-R1.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also means the reward has to be <b>verifiable</b>. There&apos;s no human in the
              loop and no model judging taste: just <code>answers_match(parsed, gold)</code>, a
              deterministic check. Grade-school math is a good fit precisely because correctness is
              decidable.

              The first smoke run produced <b>0 tagged completions out of 80</b>. Not 0% accuracy:
              the base model was often doing the arithmetic correctly. It just ignored the format
              instruction and answered in prose.

            <p>
              The reward parser looks for an <code>&lt;answer&gt;</code> block. No block means no
              parsed answer, which means reward 0, for <em>every</em> completion in the group. And
              when every member of a group scores identically, every advantage is zero, so the
              gradient is zero. The run wasn&apos;t learning slowly. It was a no-op burning GPU
              hours.

          </div>
          <div className="prose">
            <p>The fix had two halves, and it needed both:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>A one-shot example in the prompt.</b> A single worked
                <code> What is 2 + 3? </code> turn showing the exact tag structure. Tagged
                completions appear at step 0 instead of never.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Grading the tag reward.</b> <code>tag_presence_reward</code> pays +0.125 per
                required tag present exactly once, instead of all-or-nothing. Now a completion with
                3 of 4 tags outscores one with 2, so there is a gradient to climb toward the format
                even before any answer is correct.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This is also why the playground sends that same one-shot: the live prompt has to be
              the prompt the model was trained and evaluated under, or the comparison would be
              measuring something else.

              A 1.5B model at 70% on GSM8K is not competitive with frontier models, and it
              isn&apos;t meant to be. The claim is narrower and, I think, more interesting: <b>a

              can buy, with every number reproducible from a seeded script in the repo. The
              forgetting check on ARC-Challenge is there for the same reason: it&apos;s the result
